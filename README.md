- **Built-in support for multiple input methods:** Pointer, mouse, touch and keyboard sensors.
- **Fully customizable & extensible:** Customize every detail: animations, transitions, behaviours, styles. Build your own sensors, collision detection algorithms, customize key bindings and much more.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard support, sensible default aria attributes, customizable screen reader instructions and live regions built-in.
